== Internal buttons

The nRF52840 DK board has five buttons. The button set off by itself resets the board. The four buttons in a cluster are ones available for use in our code. On the board they have labels BUTTON1 through BUTTON4, but their aliases in code are `sw0` through `sw3`. If you have not encountered it before, _sw_ is a common abbreviation for _switch_ in electronics.

. Create a new application called `led-enabler`.
. Enter the following code into `main.c`.

<1> The node identifier for BUTTON1 is obtained using its alias: `sw0`.
<2> Buttons, like LEDs, are controlled by GPIO pins. The process of getting the GPIO specifications is the same for buttons as it is for LEDs.
<3> A integer variable is declared to hold the state of the button.
<4> Although it was not done in the xref:lab1.adoc[Lab 1] examples, it is best practice to always check that peripherals are ready before attempting to use them. The function `gpio_is_ready_dt` returns `true` if the specified GPIO pin is ready. The code that follows in the curly braces will only be executed if the GPIO pin connected to the LED is ready for use.
<5> The `else` statement marks the beginning of code that will be executed if `gpio_is_ready_dt` returns `false`.
<6> The `return` command causes the `main` function to be exited, sending a value of -1 to the kernel (the code that called `main` at startup). A return value of 0 is usually used to signal success and negative values indicate various types of errors.
<7> The pin connected to BUTTON1 is configured as an input.
<8> The state of the button is read and its value (0 for released and 1 for pressed) is saved in the variable `btn_pressed`.
<9> The LED is set to have the same value as the button (on if pressed, off if released).
+
 Add the build configuration through the nRF Connect side bar and build the application.
. Connect the development board to the computer and then use the btn:[Flash] action to send the program to it.
. Verify that LED1 is only lit while BUTTON1 is held down.

== Controlling external LEDs

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) do not have a constant resistance.  For low voltages, they have a nearly infinite resistance (allow no current to flow).  However, once the voltage exceeds a color-specific threshold, the resistance drops rapidly to nearly zero, allowing small changes in the voltage to create large changes in the current.  If too much current flows through the LED, it will overheat and die.  To prevent this, we will almost always connect a resistor in series with the LED.  A 330 {Omega} resistor keeps the current to a safe level for the LEDs we will be using and with the voltage that our microcontroller can supply.  A 330 {Omega} resistor has the color bands orange-orange-brown.  The gold band indicates that the manufacturer guarantees that the actual resistance is within 5% of the indicated value.

LEDs are also unidirectional devices.  That is, they have a preferred direction for the flow of current.  It takes a much larger voltage to cause a current to flow the "`wrong`" way (and the LED won't usually survive the experience if it does manage to happen).  To help us know which  direction they should be connected, manufacturers almost always make the legs of LEDs different lengths.  The longer leg goes on the side closer to the higher voltage and the shorter leg goes on the side closer to ground.

Construct the circuit shown in <<img-circuit1-breadboardview>> on your breadboard. The ground connection (one of the header sockets marked **GND** on the development board) should be connected to the bus strip that is marked with the blue (or black, depending on the breadboard manufacturer) line.  We will be consistent about doing this throughout the course because it will make debugging your circuits easier (and it is the convention in this field).  The apparent lengths of the LED legs in this diagram are solely due to how far they had to travel to reach their proper holes.  So, even though it appears that a longer leg is attached to the ground bus strip, that is not the case.  The *short* leg of each LED should be connected to the ground bus.

=== Exploring GPIO output with an oscilloscope

====
[[exercise-oscilloscope-digitalout]]
.Exercise {lab}.{counter:exercise}
In this exercise you will use a compact oscilloscope, the _Analog Discovery 2_, to learn more about the voltages in this circuit.  The results of your measurements should be written on the <<exercise-oscilloscope-digitalout>> worksheet and turned in when you are done.

. Start by connecting an _Analog Discovery 2_ to a computer with the WaveForms program (freely available from https://store.digilentinc.com/waveforms-download-only/[Digilent]).
. Connect the flywire labeled *1+* (top left, orange) to the same column as the junction between the wire from P0.29 and the resistor.  Connect the flywire labeled *1-* (bottom left, orange with white stripe) to the ground bus strip.  Also connect a flywire labeled ground (black wire) to the ground bus strip.
. Start the WaveForms program. Click on the Scope button on the left side of the screen.
. You are only using channel 1 of the oscilloscope so turn off the channel 2 display by unchecking its box on the right side of the screen, as shown below. +
image:lab2/waveforms-screen-scope-channel2.png[Disable Channel 2,225,195]
. All of the voltages you will be measuring should be positive so we want the position of 0 volts to be at the bottom of the display, not at the center.  To accomplish this, change the Channel 1 offset to -2 V.
. Just above the channels settings are the time settings (the horizontal axis).  Set Base to 50 ms/div.
. The oscilloscope needs to know when to capture the voltage that will be displayed. This is done by setting a *trigger* condition (which channel to monitor, whether to activate on a rising or falling voltage, and at what particular voltage).  We want channel 1, rising, and 1 V.  The defaults should be channel 1 and rising so you only need to change the level in the trigger settings above the main display. +
image:lab2/waveforms-screen-scope-trigger-settings.png[Trigger level setting,535,23]
. Click the Single acquisition button. +
image:lab2/waveforms-screen-scope-single.png[Single acquisition button,138,19]
. The main display should now have a bold yellow line that is tracing out the off-on-off pattern of the P0.29 output.  The pale yellow represents the noise present in this measurement (the oscilloscope acquired many samples and the bold yellow represents an average).  We don't need to see the noise so we will turn it off.  Click on the gear icon in the channel 1 settings area. +
image:lab2/waveforms-screen-scope-channel1-config.png[Channel 1 configuration,112,49]
. Uncheck the Noise option.  This should remove the pale yellow region and just leave the bold yellow line.
. To activate the Measurements tab, select menu:View[Measurements].
. To display the average value of the "`on`" state, select menu:Add[Defined Measurement > Channel 1 > Vertical > High] and then click btn:[Add].  You are done (for now) configuring measurements, so click btn:[Close].
. I will routinely refer to the microcontroller's output as being 3.3 V, but that is just an approximate value.  Use the oscilloscope to measure the actual output voltage of your microcontroller.  Record the total potential difference stem:[\Delta V_\mathrm{total}] (between P0.29 and ground).  This is what has been measured by the *High* setting.
. Measure the potential difference across the resistor by moving the *1-* flywire to the right side of the resistor (at the junction between the resistor and the LED).  The ground flywire should remain connected to the ground bus strip.  Record the potential difference stem:[\Delta V_R] across the resistor.
. Measure the potential difference across the LED by moving the *1+* and *1-* flywires to be on either side of the LED.  Record the potential difference stem:[\Delta V_\mathrm{LED}].
. Kirchhoff's voltage law tells us that stem:[\Delta V_\mathrm{total} = \Delta V_R + \Delta V_\mathrm{LED}] (assuming there are insignificant voltage drops at the various junctions).  Do your measurements agree?
. Calculate the current through the resistor using Ohm's law:
+
[stem]
++++
I = \frac{\Delta V_R}{R}.
++++
+
This same current also flows through the LED because the resistor and LED are connected in series.
. Repeat these steps for P0.03 and the green LED.
====

====
[[exercise-oscilloscope-digitalout-timing]]
.Exercise {lab}.{counter:exercise}
In this exercise you will continue to explore the behavior of the microcontroller's digital output, but the focus will be on its time response.

. Connect the flywire labeled *1+* (top left, orange) to the same column as the junction between the wire from P0.29 and the resistor.  Connect the flywire labeled *1-* (bottom left, orange with white stripe) to the ground bus strip.  Connect the ground flywire to the ground bus strip.
. In the Time settings (found in the right panel), change Base to 50 ns/div and Position to 100 ns.  In the Measurements panel, select menu:Add[Defined Measurement > Channel 1 > Horizontal > RiseTime] and click btn:[Add] and then btn:[Close].
. Click the btn:[Single] acquisition button to capture a zoomed-in view of the transition of the P0.29 from off to on.
. The crosses indicate when the particular values measured by the oscilloscope and these are then connected by straight lines.  As you can see, we are pushing the limits of this oscilloscope.  We can get a little more from it by using some of the advanced settings in the Time menu.  Click on the downward arrow to expand the Time settings.  Change Oversampling to 16. +
image:lab2/waveforms-screen-scope-time-advanced.png[Oversampling in Time settings,109,115] +
Oversampling acquires multiple captures, each with small shifts in the starting time.  For a repetitive event this allows us to effectively get data points closer together.
. Measure the risetime, the time it takes to go from the low voltage state to the high voltage state.

IMPORTANT: Show your worksheet to the instructor when you have completed both exercises.

[[assignment-rate-toggler]]
.Assignment {lab}.{counter:assignment}
We can also make the action of a complete button press (depressed followed by a release) rotate through different blinking rates. This means that we need to keep track of additional information that reflects its history, not just the current status of the button. This information is called the *state* of the system. In this example there are two important state variables to store:

* the current flash rate (which initially has two options: slow and fast)
* the previous status of the button

as well as the current status of the button. The flow diagram in <<img-blinkratetogglerflow>> gives an overview of the logic required to implement blink rate toggling with this state information.

[#img-blinkratetogglerflow]
.Diagram of the logic for the blink rate toggle program. This requires two stored state variables: one for the blink rate and one for the previous button status.
image::lab3/heart_rate_toggler.png[Breadboard view of circuit 1,324]

The status of a GPIO can be represented as either true or false, so we will store that state in a boolean variable (specified with the keyword `bool`). The other state variable holds information about the flash rate mode. In the current program we have begin with two possible options for that, but you will soon extend that to a third option. Because it is countable an obvious choice is once again an integer variable. We could use the standard `int` for this, but to make the code easier for humans to understand we will instead use a special integer version: `enum`.

The name `enum` is short for enumerated. This is a word that means something is associated with a number. In this case we are going to write our program using human-friendly names to refer to the different flashing rate modes, but behind the scenes these will be stored as integers. The first thing we do is to define that enumeration:
----
  enum rateState_t {FastMode, SlowMode};
----
Our custom variable type is given the name `rateState_t`. It has only two possible values: `FastMode` and `SlowMode`. The computer treats these as if they were the numbers 0 (for `FastMode`) and 1 (for `SlowMode`).

NOTE: A C convention is to end custom variable type names with `_t` and to write the possible value names of an `enum` in upper camel case. 

Inside of the `main` function we will then declare a variable `rateMode` that is of this type and is initially set to the fast mode.
----
  enum rateState_t rateMode = FastMode;
----
The meaning of this is less ambiguous to a human reader of the code than the alternative version using the standard `int`:
----
  int rateMode = 0;
----

The previous program had an `if...else` statement with a simple condition. The state of the button was either 0 or 1. This time we will need to select among several options based on the value of `rateMode`. We could use a series of `if` statements to direct the code, but a better solution in C is the `switch` structure.

A `switch` structure begins by specifying the variable that we will be testing. We then specify the possible options using the `case` keyword. The code to be run if that option is selected follows and `break;` indicates where it ends. In our case this becomes
[source,c]
----
switch (rateMode) {
    case FastMode: k_msleep(FAST_SLEEP_TIME); break;
    case SlowMode: k_msleep(SLOW_SLEEP_TIME); break;
}
----

This code has been made compact so it displays better on the printed page or small screens. However, it is not necessary
to have the case statements written all on one line. The key thing is that the statements that are part of
a particular case begin after the colon (`:`) and end with `break;`. For example, one could write these over
multiple lines and use indentation to indicate the block.
[source,c]
----
switch (rateMode) {
    case FastMode:
        k_msleep(FAST_SLEEP_TIME);
        break;
    case SlowMode:
        k_msleep(SLOW_SLEEP_TIME);
        break;
}
----
This style is useful if there is more complex logic for each case. We will encounter situations like that
latter in the course.

Next we have the compound condition "`Is the current button state different than the previous button state AND is the button currently released?`" We can break this into three questions:

* Is the button currently released?
* Is the current button state not equal to the previous button state?
* Are the answers to questions 1 and 2 both yes?

We will now look at each these in turn, assuming the current state of the button is saved to `currBtn` and the previous state of the button to `prevBtn`.
[horizontal,labelwidth=20]
Question 1:: Remembering that the button reads `false` when it is released, the condition corresponding to the question "`Is the button currently released?`" is `!currBtn` where `!` is how C represents the logical NOT operation.
Question 2:: The NOT EQUAL logic operator in C is `!=`. This means the condition "`Is the current button state NOT EQUAL to the previous button state?`" is `currBtn != prevBtn`.
Question 3:: The question "`Are the answers to questions 1 and 2 both yes`" requires the AND logic operator. In C AND is written as `&&`. We need to enclose each of the condition statements inside of parentheses so the opening of this `if...else` structure is finally given as:
----
if ((currBtn != prevBtn) && (!currBtn)) {
