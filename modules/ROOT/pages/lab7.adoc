= Lab 7: Introduction to SPI Communication

== Listening to an SPI "`controller`"

We will start with a simple example of SPI communication, with the nRF52840 acting as controller (master) and no peripherals (slaves) listening.  However, our _Analog Discovery 2_ will eavesdrop on the communication and this will be our first time to use its *Logic* app.  The nRF52840 will repeatedly transmit one byte containing the value 0xA1 using the code in <<program-simple-spi-master>>.

. Create a new application.
. Edit `prj.conf` to enable both logging and SPI drivers.

.The SPI and logging modules must be enabled in `prj.conf`.

.Exercise {lab}.{counter:exercise}

. Convert 0xA1 to binary.
. Connect a ground flywire to GND on the development board.
. Connect flywire *0* (pink) to p0.30 on the nRF52840. This is the chip select pin.
. Connect flywire *1* (green) to p0.28 on the nRF52840. This is the SCK (SPI clock) pin.
. Connect flywire *2* (purple) to p0.29 on the nRF52840. This is the MOSI (master out/slave in) pin.
. There is no need to connect anything to p0.31. This is the MISO (master in/slave out) pin and there is no slave to listen to (yet).
. Start _Waveforms_ and launch the *Logic* app.
. Click on the green plus sign to add a logic channel to be monitored. +
image:lab7/Add-Logic-Channel.png[]
. Select SPI for the logic protocol and then change *Format* to Hexadecimal.  If you followed the directions above, then Select (slave select), Clock, and Data (MOSI) should be fine with their defaults.
. Next, change the Trigger type from *Simple* to *Protocol*. +
image:lab7/Trigger-type-protocol.png[]
. Select SPI as the protocol type and then Start as the condition to trigger on.
. In the Time settings, set Position to 50 us and Base to 20 us/div.
. Click btn:[Single] acquisition.
. Observe the following features:
.. The *Select* signal is high until the slave is selected by setting it *low*.  It remains low until the end of the transmission.
.. The *Clock* signal is normally *low* (as expected for Mode 0 operation). Once the payload is ready to be transmitted the clock signal begins.
.. The *Data* signal is set to its new value before the *Clock* signal rises for each bit of the payload. To better see this, change the Base to 1 us/div and click btn:[Single] again. Notice that you can now that Data changes shortly after the clock signal falls.
.. Set the Base back to 20 us/div and click btn:[Single] again. Verify that you got the expected binary value (corresponding to 0xA1) by looking at the value of *Data* at the times that the *Clock* moved from low to high (as expected for Mode 0 operation).
.. Finally, note that _Waveforms_ has decoded this and displays hA1 above this transmission.
. Sketch the three signals on the worksheet, with downward arrows pointing from the *Clock* to *Data* at each of the rising clock transmissions.

<1> The ADXL345 requires two bytes to configure its registers. The first byte is the register address and the second byte is the value to write to that register.
<2> The ADXL345 requires one byte to prepare it to read its registers. The `tx_buffer` is reused for this purpose, but the length is set to 1.
<3> The ADXL345 returns 16-bit values for each of the x, y, and z axes.
<4> The 16-bit values are converted to g's using the conversion factor of 0.004 g/LSB.
<5> The ADXL345 requires a short delay after configuring its registers.
<6> The ADXL345 requires the CS line to be held low between the write and read operations. The `SPI_HOLD_ON_CS` flag turns off the default behavior of releasing the CS line after each operation.
<7> The CS line is released after the read operation.
<8> The 16-bit values are combined from two bytes. The least significant byte is first in the buffer. The second byte is shifted left 8 bits and then combined with the first byte.

====
[[exercise-spi-accelerometer]]
.Exercise {lab}.{counter:exercise}

. Connect the ADXL345 as described in the program header.
. Create a new project containing <<program-spi-accelerometer>>.
. With the accelerometer resting on the table, verify that you get about 1 g along the z axis and about 0 along the x and y axes.
. Tilt the accelerometer and observe how the values change.
. Provide acceleration in various directions and observe the results.

IMPORTANT: Demonstrate successful operation of your circuit.

== Your Turn

=== Tap detection

In this assignment you will demonstrate your ability to use SPI and to extract information from an electronic component data sheet.  You will configure an accelerometer to detect single and double taps.  Internal nRF52840 LEDs will be used to indicate whether a single tap or a double tap event has occurred.

==== Project requirements:

* The majority of your code will be spent configuring the accelerometer prior to putting it into Measure mode and entering a `while` loop.  A summary of the configuration commands for the tap features of the ADXL345 appears below, but full details are on the data sheet https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/adxl345.pdf[available from the manufacturer^].
* The ADXL345 interrupts will be configured to set INT2 high when either a single or double tap event has occurred. INT2 will be connected to nRF52840 p0.04 (configured as a GPIO).
* Inside of the `while` loop, you will check to see if the accelerometer has indicated something happened (p0.04 switches from high to low). If it did, you will communicate with the ADXL345 via SPI and determine whether a single or double tap was detected. Note: when a double tap occurs the ADXL345 will also say a single tap occurred (because a double tap consists of at least one tap). We want **our** single tap indicator to mean that one and only one tap was detected so be careful with the logic.
* It will turn on LED1 if a single tap was detected (but not one that was part of a double tap) and LED2 if a double tap was detected. These will remain lit for 1 second.

==== Tasks

. Access the GitHub Classroom link for this assignment on Blackboard.
. Follow the usual steps for getting started with a repository from GitHub Classroom.
. Your first task is to edit the `Accelerometer-Info-Summary.md` file in the template project and fill in the missing parts by looking at the ADXL345 data sheet (available through Blackboard).
. The configuration of the accelerometer should occur once, outside of the `while` loop.
. Don't forget to set the power control register to Measure mode as the last step before entering the `while` loop.
. Inside of the `while` loop, your program should check to see if there is an alert on p0.04. If there is, then communicate with the accelerometer and read the interrupt source byte.
. Set the LEDs if a tap has been detected and then keep them on for 1 second.
. When you are satisfied with its operation, finish documenting your code with comments and a detailed `README.md`.

IMPORTANT: When your program and circuit are working successfully, remember to push the commits to the remote repository. Also, take a video of its successful operation (along with your reflection) and upload this to Blackboard.
