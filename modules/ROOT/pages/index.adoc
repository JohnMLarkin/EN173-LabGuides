This site is under development with an expected completion of January 1, 2025. Until then, all content is subject to change without warning.

This is a collection of lab guides for the course _EN 173: Introduction to Embedded Systems_ taught by John Larkin at https://www.whitworth.edu[Whitworth University]. The development board used throughout these guides is https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF52840-DK[Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52840 DK]. In addition, Nordic Semiconductor's https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF-Connect-SDK[nRF Connect SDK] and the associated https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-VS-Code[Visual Studio Code extension] are used to provide a development environment that is relatively accessible for a student first encountering embedded systems. However, the course also targets the https://zephyrproject.org/[Zephyr RTOS] which is designed to be portable across a broad selection of platforms so much of what is found in these guides should be applicable to other microcontrollers with only minor changes.

****
In this set of activities you will:

* install the development environment,
* create a simple program to flash an LED on the development board,
* transfer that program to the development board, and
* learn how to document the program using Markdown.

Additional hardware required: none

.xref::lab2.adoc[Lab 2 -- Basic Digital Input and Output]
[%collapsible]
====
****
In this set of activities you will:

* use a button internal to the development board,
* connect the development board to external circuit elements (LEDs and resistors),
* modify the devicetree to enable use of additional digital output pins, and
* use an oscilloscope to observe the output of a GPIO pin.

Additional hardware required:

* two LEDs (described as red and green in instructions)
* two 330 {Omega} resistors
* oscilloscope (instructions describe usage of https://digilent.com/shop/analog-discovery-2-100ms-s-usb-oscilloscope-logic-analyzer-and-variable-power-supply[Digilent's _Analog Discovery 2_])

====
****
In this set of activities you will:

* modify the devicetree to enable use of additional digital input pins,
* use an external slide switch and momentary push button,
* and use a photointerrupter to detect light-blocking events.

Additional hardware required:

* two LEDs (described as red and green in instructions)
* two 330 {Omega} resistors
* slide switch (SPDT)
* momentary push button (SPST)
* photointerrupter (https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/isocom-components-2004-ltd/H21A1/126287[Isocom H21A1])
* 10 k{Omega} resistor

.xref::lab4.adoc[Lab 4 -- Direct GPIO Port Writing and Reading]
[%collapsible]
====
****
In this set of activities you will:

* set the state of multiple pins on the same GPIO port with a single command,
* get the state of all of the pins on a GPIO port with a single command,
* use multi-pin writes to control a seven-segment display, and
* begin to use functions to make your code more modular.

Additional hardware required:

* seven-segment display (https://www.jameco.com/z/LSD3211-11-Ligitek-LED-Display-7-Segment-Red-0-30-Inch-Common-Cathode-LHDP-RHDP-2-5mcd_24782.html[Ligitek LSD3211-11])
* photointerrupter (https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/isocom-components-2004-ltd/H21A1/126287[Isocom H21A1])
* 10 k{Omega} resistor
* 330 {Omega} resistor
